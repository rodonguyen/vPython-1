[Original vPython](https://github.com/ANRGUSC/vPython) developed by Dr. Gowri Ramachandran (g.ramachandran (at) qut.edu.au)

[WhistleBlower: Towards A Decentralized and Open Platform for Spotting Fake News](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/209248/)

This version of vPython is a simplification by Tao Liu (t24.liu (at) connect.qut.edu.au) and was built for testing purposes.   
I, Rodo (rodonguyendd (at) gmail.com), have used it in a collaborating research with Dr. Gowri from 2022-2023. The code repository of this is [VRES_CODE_2021](https://github.com/rodonguyen/vres_code_2021)

# [Install from Scratch (i.e. in a completely new machine) Guide here](./install_from_scratch_guide.md)
Your machine may not have all the required packages to install vPython so take a look at this guide for more instruction/troubleshoot.

## P/S
!!! This vPython will overwrite your existed Python3.9 if it is already installed.
